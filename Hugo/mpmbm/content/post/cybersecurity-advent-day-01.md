Today's [Cybersecurity tip](/cyber-security-advent) is: **update your devices**

The most effective way to stay safe is to run the latest patches and software updates on your computer and mobile devices. While we hear all the time about zero-day vulnerabilities, most exploits happen because of known vulnerabilities that have been in the wild for a while. Having the latest updates and patches will protect against the known exploits. Having automated updates enabled will help protect against zero-day vulnerabilities because you'll be updated as soon as your provider has a fix!

Fortunately, most device makers have made this process almost mindless. Your take-away today should be to check your computer and/or phone to make sure you're up-to-date AND you have automated updates enabled.

Here's how to do that on some of the more popular platforms:

**Windows 10**

- _Operating system_ updates are done through **Settings -> Update & Security** and just verify your settings (active hours, restart options, etc)
- _Apps downloaded through the Microsoft Store_ are done through **Microsoft Store -> Settings** and make sure "Update apps automatically" is turned on
- _Apps downloaded manually_ will need to be updated through the settings in those apps

**Mac OS X High Sierra**

- Both _Operating System_ and _app_ updates are done through **System Preferences -> App Store** and make sure "Automatically check for updates" (with appropriate preferences) is checked

**Android O**

- _Operating System_ automatic updates are enabled by default, but you can verify by going to **System -> System update** to see the last date and time the phone checked
- To make sure your _apps_ are updated, visit **Play Store -> Settings -> Auto-update apps** and select the appropriate choice (wifi only or at any time)

**iOS 11**

- _Operating System_ updates are in **Settings -> General -> Software Update**; these are automatically enabled, but you can verify here
- _App_ updates are enabled in **Settings -> iTunes & App Stores** and toggle "Updates" to on

See you tomorrow!
